# FastDoc

## Purpose

This full-stack project was created for the module Enterprise Solution Development. It has a service-oriented architecture with microservices in containers that are orchestrated by complex services, which then serve content to the front-end.

## Description

FastDoc is an enterprise solution that allows customers to book house-call appointments with doctors. The following are the user stories that are implemented:

1. After customer views available doctors, he makes a booking and makes payment.
2. Customer views his current bookings
3. Doctor views his completed and upcoming jobs
4. Doctor starts a job before visiting the patient.
5. Doctor gives a prescription to a patient
6. Doctor stops a job after completing a visit.
7. Administrative staff makes posts on Facebook through our enterprise solution



## Technology

### MySQL

We used MySQL for database management.

### Flask

Flask is used to create the microservices and Flask-SQLchemy is used for ORM.

### Docker

Docker is used to containerise the different atomic and complex microservices.

### RabbitMQ

We used RabbitMQ for message-based communication in certain portions of the business process

### Javascript, HTML, CSS

These 3 makes up the front-end solution.
